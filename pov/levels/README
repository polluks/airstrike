Level files
===========

Here are level background POV scene files.
By default the backgrounds are made to 800x600 size.

Files for each level are:
- <name>.pov       -- POV source file for <name> level background
- <name>.png       -- rendered level background
- <name>-mask.png  -- rendered level background mask

All the background objects in the POV files which
shouldn't affect the sprites, should be enclosed into:
--------------
#ifndef(MASK)
background { color rgb<0.8,0.75,1.0> }
#end
--------------

This way both the background and it's mask PNG files can be
created *automatically* from the same POV file.

Background shouldn't have any completely black objects.


Level directories
=================

From the level files here is created a directory structure like this:
<level-nro>/
- bg.jpg
- mask.png
- thumb.png

Where each <name> is mapped to certain <level-nro> in the Makefile.


In addition these are required for level to be complete
- description.txt  -- describes the level to the user
- settings         -- tells airstrike what objects the level has and where
