The Galaxy Include File package consists of four files (<I>Galaxy.inc,
Galaxy.bg, Galaxy.obj</I> and <I>Galaxy.sf</I>) which work separately and together,
depending on the desired effect.  All four files should be copied to
one of the directories (folders) in your POV-Ray library path.  Normally
this is the <I>INCLUDE</I> sub-directory of the directory where you installed
POV-Ray, so if you installed POV-Ray in <I>C:\POVRAY</I> you should copy the files
to <I>C:\POVRAY\INCLUDE</I>.  On a Windows 95 system, this is probably something
like:

<P><I>C:\Program Files\POV-Ray for Windows\Include</I>

<P>On UNIX and similar systems, where filenames are case-sensitive, you may
have to rename the four include files so that the filenames are all uppercase.
This will enable you to render the sample files without modification.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
The Galaxy Include File package allows you to create a variety of outer-
space scenes which can be used on their own or as backgrounds to other
scenes and animations.  In addition to spiral galaxies, the Galaxy Include
File package can also create starfields, star clusters, nebulae, comets,
and meteor showers.  You can easily create a galaxy scene containing a
selection of these elements by adding the following lines to a POV-Ray
scene file:

<P><CODE>#declare galaxy_seed = 123456789;
<BR>#include "GALAXY.INC"</CODE>

<P>You can choose any positive or negative integer you like for the
<A HREF="#galaxy_seed">galaxy_seed</A> value.  When you render this scene, the Galaxy Include File
will select random options, and then use <I>Galaxy.bg, Galaxy.obj,</I> and
<I>Galaxy.sf</I> to create the galaxy scene.  In addition to changing the seed
number, you can use a variety of options to modify the galaxy scene.
To use any of these options just add the following line to your scene file,
<I>before</I> including <I>Galaxy.inc</I>:

<P><CODE>#declare </CODE><I>[variable-name]</I><CODE> = </CODE><I>[value]</I>

<P>substituting the desired variable name and value where appropriate.
Note that <I>Galaxy.inc</I> (or any of the <I>Galaxy.*</I> files) should <B>never</B> be
included at the start of a scene (like <I>colors.inc</I> or <I>textures.inc</I>).
They should only be included after declaring the desired galaxy options.

<P>As well as creating random galaxy scenes using <I>Galaxy.inc</I>, you can use
<I>Galaxy.bg, Galaxy.obj</I>, and/or <I>Galaxy.sf</I> separately to build custom galaxy
scenes piece by piece.  You can include any of the four <I>Galaxy.*</I> files as
many times as you want in a single POV-Ray scene, declaring separate options
for each <I>Galaxy.*</I> inclusion.  Note that you don't have to redeclare any
options that are common to any or all of the <I>Galaxy.*</I> files, eg:

<P><CODE>// COMMON GALAXY OPTIONS
<BR>#declare galaxy_colour1 = &lt 1.3, 1.2, .8&gt ;
<BR>#declare galaxy_colour2 = &lt 1, .5, .3 &gt ;
<BR>#declare galaxy_rotate = &lt 90, 180, 0&gt ;

<P>// GALAXY BACKGROUND
<BR>#declare galaxy_bgstars = 4;
<BR>#declare galaxy_bgnebula = off;
<BR>#declare galaxy_nebula_sphere = 5;
<BR>#include "GALAXY.BG"

<P>// GALAXY OBJECTS
<BR>#declare galaxy_object_name = "Nebula3"
<BR>#declare galaxy_cluster_name = "Star4"
<BR>#include "GALAXY.OBJ"

<BR>#declare galaxy_object_name = "Comet2"
<BR>#declare galaxy_cluster_name = ""
<BR>#include "GALAXY.OBJ"</CODE>

<P>In the above example the same colours and rotation are applied to each
element of the galaxy scene, without having to redeclare them each time
you include one of the <I>Galaxy.*</I> files.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT GALAXY.* FILES</B></I></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
As mentioned above, the four different files of the Galaxy Include File
package can be used in a variety of ways, depending on how you wish to
create your galaxy scene.  The files are:

<P>The Galaxy Backgrounds File (<I>GALAXY.BG</I>): this include file is used to
create a selection of starfield and nebula pigments (including a Milky Way
pigment), which can either be mapped directly to the sky_sphere, or to an
actual sphere object.  Although <I>Galaxy.bg</I> allows you to create backgrounds
quite easily, the file gives you little control over the exact shape of the
nebulae, and the starfields are not suitable for anti-aliasing or
animations in which the camera is moved or altered in some way.

<P>The Galaxy Starfield File (<I>GALAXY.SF</I>): this include file is used to create
starfields consisting of actual objects, rather than textures.  Because of
this, the starfields can be anti-aliased and animated very well, and
improved programming means that the parsing takes about one fifth of the
time needed for previous versions of the Starfield Include File.  <I>Galaxy.sf</I>
can create three different types of stars, and can be used in conjunction
with <I>Galaxy.bg</I> to create stars larger than one pixel in size.

<P>The Galaxy Objects File (<I>GALAXY.OBJ</I>): this include file is used to create
and position a selection of outer-space objects, including four different
feature stars, six different nebulae, five different galaxies, three
different comets, and two different meteors.  The objects can be positioned
individually, or in random clusters (eg. star clusters or meteor showers).

<P>The Galaxy Include File (<I>GALAXY.INC</I>): this include file uses the above three
files to create random galaxy scenes.  <I>Galaxy.inc</I> selects random options for
the other files, including colours, object types, scaling, rotation, etc.,
and can automatically include the other files into your POV-Ray scene, making
it quick and easy to use the Galaxy Include File package without having to
declare separate options for each of the <I>Galaxy.*</I> files.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>GALAXY OPTIONS</B></I></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
This section explains the various options that can be used with <I>Galaxy.inc</I>,
as well as the options that can be used separately with <I>Galaxy.bg,
Galaxy.obj</I>, and <I>Galaxy.sf</I>.

<P>Note that the Galaxy Include File package supports both British and
American English, eg: <I>galaxy_colour</I> and <I>galaxy_color</I> are interchangeable,
as are <I>galaxy_colouration</I> and <I>galaxy_coloration</I>, etc.


<P><HR><A NAME="INC Options"></A>
<B>GALAXY INCLUDE FILE OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
The options in this section apply to <I>Galaxy.inc</I>.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_seed"></A>
<B>galaxy_seed</B>
<HR>
This is the random number seed used for all random aspects of the Galaxy
Include File package.  Changing this number can result in vastly different
galaxy scenes, and any positive or negative integer accepted by POV-Ray can
be used.  The default <I>galaxy_seed</I> value is 0.  Each time you include
<I>Galaxy.inc</I>, a new <I>galaxy_seed</I> value is chosen at random.  To find out the
new value, see <A HREF="#debug_options">debug_options</A>.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_colour"></A>
<B>galaxy_colour</B>
<HR>
Use this option to change the overall colour of the galaxy scene.  The
exact result of changing this option depends on the current colour of
the galaxy scene, eg. if the current galaxy scene is predominantly green,
setting <I>galaxy_colour</I> to &lt 1.5, 0.1, 1&gt will increase the amount of red
in the scene, decrease the amount of green, and leave the blue unaltered,
resulting in a purple coloured galaxy.
<BR>The default <I>galaxy_colour</I> value is &lt 1, 1, 1&gt (which has no effect).

<P><A NAME="galaxy_colouration"></A>
<B>galaxy_colouration</B>
<HR>
Use this option to increase of decrease the amount of colour in the galaxy
scene.  Good values range from 0 (little or no colour) to 1 or larger (very
saturated colour).  Setting this option to a low value means that the
<A HREF="#galaxy_colour">galaxy_colour</A> option has more of an effect.
<BR>The default <I>galaxy_colouration</I> value is 0.5

<P><A NAME="galaxy_colour_turb"></A>
<B>galaxy_colour_turb</B>
<HR>
Use this option to alter the amount of colour variation between different
elements of the galaxy scene.  Setting this option to 0 results in a
monochromatic galaxy scene, while larger values give greater colour
variation.  The default <I>galaxy_colour_turb</I> value is 0.2

<P><A NAME="galaxy_intensity"></A>
<B>galaxy_intensity</B>
<HR>
Use this option to increase or decrease the overall visibility of the
galaxy scene.  Good values usually lie somewhere between 0 (completely
transparent) and 5 (very opaque).
<BR>The default <I>galaxy_intensity</I> value is 1

<P><A NAME="galaxy_rotate"></A>
<B>galaxy_rotate</B>
<HR>
This option is a vector that is used to rotate the galaxy scene as a whole.
It can be useful when you want to create the illusion of movement in an
animation, without having to transform the camera and all the other objects
in a scene.  The default <I>galaxy_rotate</I> value is &lt 0, 0, 0&gt

<P><A NAME="galaxy_distance"></A>
<B>galaxy_distance</B>
<HR>
All the objects in a galaxy scene are arranged around a giant sphere,
usually surrounding the camera.  You can use this option to set the size of
this sphere.  The default value is 10000, which should be sufficient for
most scenes and animations.  If the rest of the objects in your scene are
this size or larger, you may need to increase this value.  However, values
that are too large may result in disappearing objects, or cause POV-Ray to
crash when rendering the scene.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_origin"></A>
<B>galaxy_origin</B>
<HR>
As mentioned above, the objects in a galaxy scene are arranged around a
giant sphere.  By default this sphere is centred around &lt 0, 0, 0&gt, but
you can use this option to change this value.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_bg"></A>
<B>galaxy_bg</B>
<HR>
Use this option to disable the elements of the galaxy scene created by the
Galaxy Backgrounds File (<I>Galaxy.bg</I>).  Setting this option to false (or off)
removes the background stars, background nebulae, and nebula sphere from
the galaxy scene.  To remove these elements individually, see <A HREF="#BG Options">Background File Options</A>.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_objects"></A>
<B>galaxy_objects</B>
<HR>
Use this option to disable the elements of the galaxy scene created by the
Galaxy Objects File (<I>Galaxy.obj</I>).  Setting this option to false (or off)
removes any feature nebulae, stars, comets, star clusters, or meteor
showers from the galaxy scene.  Note that this option is always set to
false after including <I>Galaxy.inc</I>; if you wish to include <I>Galaxy.inc</I> a
second time (or third, fourth, etc.) and have it automatically create galaxy
objects, you must manually set <I>galaxy_objects</I> to true before including
<I>Galaxy.inc</I>.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_starfield"></A>
<B>galaxy_starfield</B>
<HR>
Use this option to remove the starfield objects in a galaxy scene created by
the Galaxy Starfield File (<I>Galaxy.sf</I>).  Note that this option is always
set to false after including <I>Galaxy.inc</I>; if you wish <I>Galaxy.inc</I> to
automatically create another starfield, you must manually set
<I>galaxy_starfield</I> to true before including <I>Galaxy.inc</I>.

<P><A NAME="options_only"></A>
<B>options_only</B>
<HR>
Setting this option to true will cause <I>Galaxy.inc</I> to declare all the options
it uses for <I>Galaxy.bg, Galaxy.obj</I>, and <I>Galaxy.sf</I>, but these three files will
not be automatically included.  You can use this to then alter selected
galaxy options, before including some or all of the remaining <I>Galaxy.*</I> files,
eg. say you have discovered you like the galaxy produced by using 7362512
as the <A HREF="#galaxy_seed">galaxy_seed</A> value, but you want to change the galaxy object used:

<P><CODE>#declare galaxy_seed = 7362512;
<BR>#declare options_only = true;
<BR>#include "GALAXY.INC"

<BR>#declare galaxy_object = "Galaxy2"
<BR>#include "GALAXY.OBJ"
<BR>#include "GALAXY.BG"
<BR>#include "GALAXY.SF"</CODE>

<P>Note that setting <I>options_only</I> to true is the same as setting <A HREF="#galaxy_bg">galaxy_bg</A>,
<A HREF="#galaxy_objects">galaxy_objects</A>, and <A HREF="#galaxy_starfield">galaxy_starfield</A> to false.

<P><A NAME="debug_options"></A>
<B>debug_options</B>
<HR>
Setting this option to true will cause <I>Galaxy.inc</I> to output all the random
option values it uses to POV-Ray's debug stream.  You can then use the +GD
command-line switch, or the Debug_File INI file setting, to direct the
debug stream to a file.  This file can then be altered as desired, and
included directly into your scene before including <I>Galaxy.bg, Galaxy.obj</I>,
and/or <I>Galaxy.sf</I> (see the <I>Rand.pov</I> and <I>Rand.ini</I> files for an example of how
this option can be used).


<P><HR><A NAME="BG Options"></A>
<B>GALAXY BACKGROUNDS FILE OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
The options in this section apply to <I>Galaxy.bg</I>.  In addition to the
options below, the Galaxy Backgrounds File supports the <A HREF="#galaxy_intensity">galaxy_intensity</A>,
<A HREF="#galaxy_rotate">galaxy_rotate</A>, <A HREF="#galaxy_distance">galaxy_distance</A>, and <A HREF="#galaxy_origin">galaxy_origin</A> options, as detailed above.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_bgstars"></A>
<B>galaxy_bgstars</B>
<HR>
This option specifies the type of background star pigment mapped to the
sky_sphere.  Values range from 1 (sparse) to 3 (dense), and 4 (sparse) to
6 (dense). The first group has a mixture of faint and light stars, while
the second is mostly composed of bright stars of different colours.  If you
don't want any background stars (for an animation, say), set this option
to false.  The default <I>galaxy_bgstars</I> value is 2

<P><A NAME="galaxy_bgnebula"></A>
<B>galaxy_bgnebula</B>
<HR>
This option specifies the type of nebula pigment mapped to the sky_sphere.
Possible values are:

<UL>1 - Default nebula
<BR>2 - Light reflection nebula
<BR>3 - Nebula criss-crossed by dark gas lanes
<BR>4 - Spidery nebula
<BR>5 - Dense reflection nebula
<BR>6 - Milky Way pattern
</UL>

<P>Values 1 to 5 correspond roughly with the nebulae created by <I>Galaxy.obj</I>
(see <A HREF="#galaxy_object_name">galaxy_object_name</A>).  If you don't want a background nebula, set this option
to false.  The default <I>galaxy_bgnebula</I> value is 6

<P><A NAME="galaxy_nebula_sphere"></A>
<B>galaxy_nebula_sphere</B>
<HR>
Use this option to create a large sphere (the radius is specified by the
<A HREF="#galaxy_distance">galaxy_distance</A> option) mapped with a nebula pigment.  Possible values are
1 to 5, corresponding to the <A HREF="#galaxy_bgnebula">galaxy_bgnebula</A> option.  If you don't want a
nebula sphere, set this value to false.
<BR>The default <I>galaxy_nebula_sphere</I> value is 1

<P><A NAME="galaxy_nebula_ambient"></A>
<B>galaxy_nebula_ambient</B>
<HR>
Use this option to change the ambient light value of the nebula sphere.
The default <I>galaxy_nebula_ambient</I> value is &lt 1, 1, 1&gt

<P><A NAME="galaxy_colour options"></A>
<B>galaxy_colour1, galaxy_colour2, galaxy_colour3</B>
<HR>
Use this option to set the RGB colour value used to create the galaxy
background pigments.  For a monochromatic galaxy scene, only declare
the first option; for a scene that uses two colours declare both
<I>galaxy_colour1</I> and <I>galaxy_colour2</I>.  Finally, to add another colour to
the galaxy pigments declare all three galaxy_colour options.
<BR>The default <I>galaxy_colour1</I> value is &lt 1, 1, 1&gt (White).

<P><A NAME="galaxy_star_colouration"></A>
<B>galaxy_star_colouration</B>
<HR>
This option sets the colour saturation used by the six background star
pigments, and by the Milky Way pigment.  Good values range from 0 (no
colour) to 1 (complete colour).  An interesting effect can be achieved by
using negative numbers, which result in the stars being the opposite colour
to the nebulae and other objects in the galaxy scene.
<BR>The default <I>galaxy_star_colouration</I> value is 0.2

<P><A NAME="galaxy_pattern_scale"></A>
<B>galaxy_pattern_scale</B>
<HR>
Use this option to alter the size of the patterns used to create the
galaxy background pigments.  Changing this option does not alter the general
shape of the pigments; it only changes the scaling of the patterns used
within each pigment.  The default <I>galaxy_pattern_scale</I> value is 1

<P><A NAME="galaxy_pattern_origin"></A>
<B>galaxy_pattern_origin</B>
<HR>
Use this option to translate the origin of the patterns used to create the
galaxy background pigments.  Changing this option can completely alter the
shapes created by the pigments, and can be changed gradually within an
animation to create dynamic nebulae, etc.
<BR>The default <I>galaxy_pattern_origin</I> is &lt 0, 0, 0&gt

<P><A NAME="galaxy_turb_origin"></A>
<B>galaxy_turb_origin</B>
<HR>
Many of the galaxy pigments use some sort of turbulence; changing this
option translates the origin of the turbulence before it is applied to the
pigment.  You can use this option to alter the shapes of various pigments,
or to animate the turbulence applied to the pigments.
<BR>The default <I>galaxy_turb_origin</I> is &lt 0, 0, 0&gt

<P><A NAME="galaxy_declare_only"></A>
<B>galaxy_declare_only</B>
<HR>
Setting this option to true stops <I>Galaxy.bg</I> from actually creating the
sky_sphere or nebula sphere to which the galaxy background pigments are
mapped.  Instead, the file declares each of the 12 pigments separately, so
that you can then use them in the ways you use any other pigment.  The
pigment names are BGStars? (from 1 to 6), BGNebula? (from 1 to 5), and
BGMilkyWay.  Each of the pigments is designed to be used at unit size, but
they can be scaled or transformed any way you want, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare galaxy_declare_only = true;
<BR>#include "GALAXY.BG"

<P>sky_sphere {
<BR>pigment {BGStars3}
<BR>pigment {BGMilkyWay rotate z * 45}
<BR>pigment {BGNebula5 scale 2}
<BR>pigment {BGNebula1 rotate &lt 60, 50, 0&gt}}

<P>box {&lt -1, -1, -1&gt, &lt 1, 1, 1&gt
<BR>pigment {BGStars6} finish {phong .5}}</CODE>

<P>Note that setting <I>galaxy_declare_only</I> to true is the same as setting
<A HREF="#galaxy_bgstars">galaxy_bgstars</A>, <A HREF="#galaxy_bgnebula">galaxy_bgnebula</A>, and <A HREF="#galaxy_nebula_sphere">galaxy_nebula_sphere</A> to false.


<P><HR><A NAME="SF Options"></A>
<B>GALAXY STARFIELD FILE OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
The options in this section apply to <I>Galaxy.sf</I>.  In addition to the
options below, the Galaxy Starfield File supports the <A HREF="#galaxy_seed">galaxy_seed</A>,
<A HREF="#galaxy_rotate">galaxy_rotate</A>, and <A HREF="#galaxy_origin">galaxy_origin</A> options, as detailed above.

<P><A NAME="star_count"></A>
<B>star_count</B>
<HR>
This option sets the number of star objects created.  The larger the number,
the longer the parsing time and memory required.
The default <I>star_count</I> value is 1000

<P><A NAME="star_colour"></A>
<B>star_colour</B>
<HR>
This option sets the RGB colour value of the stars.
The default star_colour value is &lt 0.9, 0.9, 0.9&gt

<P><A NAME="star_type"></A>
<B>star_type</B>
<HR>
This option selects the pigment used on each star object.  Possible
values are:

<UL>1 - Plain circular star (default)
<BR>2 - Circular star with halo
<BR>3 - Circular star with six evenly spaced rays
</UL>

<P><A NAME="star_scale"></A>
<B>star_scale</B>
<HR>
Use this option to increase or decrease the size of the star objects.  By
default the stars are designed to look best when rendered at resolutions
between 320x240 and 640x480; you may wish use smaller numbers for larger
resolutions, and vice-versa.
The default <I>star_scale</I> value is 1

<P><A NAME="star_distance"></A>
<B>star_distance</B>
<HR>
The star objects are arranged around a large sphere; this option sets the
radius of this sphere.  The default value is 20000, which should be
sufficient for most scenes and animations.  If the rest of the objects in
your scene are this size or larger, you may need to increase this value.
However, values that are too large may result in disappearing objects, or
cause POV-Ray to crash when rendering the scene.

<P><A NAME="star_spread"></A>
<B>star_spread</B>
<HR>
This option sets the difference between the distances to the closest
(largest) star and the farthest (smallest) star.  The option is expressed
as a percentage of the <A HREF="#star_distance">star_distance</A>, eg: the default value of 1 means that
the stars lie somewhere between 20000 and 40000 units away (40000 being
equal to 20000 plus 20000 times 1).  Setting this option to 0 would result
in all the star objects being the same distance from the origin.

<P><A NAME="star_distribution"></A>
<B>star_distribution</B>
<HR>
This option sets the ratio of large (close) stars to small (far) stars.
The default value of 1 results in equal numbers of each.   Values larger
than 1 give more large stars, while values smaller than 1 give more small
stars.

<P><A NAME="star_colour_turb"></A>
<B>star_colour_turb</B>
<HR>
Use this option to alter the amount of colour variation between different
stars.  Setting this option to 0 results in stars all of the same colour,
while larger values give greater colour variation.
The default <I>star_colour_turb</I> value is 0.2

<P><A NAME="star_brightness_turb"></A>
<B>star_brightness_turb</B>
<HR>
Use this option to set the amount of brightness variation between different
stars.  Setting this option to 0 results in stars all of the same brightness,
while larger values give greater brightness variation.
The default <I>star_brightness_turb</I> value is 0.5


<P><HR><A NAME="OBJ Options"></A>
<B>GALAXY OBJECTS FILE OPTIONS</B>
<HR>
The options in this section apply to <I>Galaxy.obj</I>.  In addition to the
options below, the Galaxy Objects File supports the following options
detailed above:

<UL><A HREF="#galaxy_seed">galaxy_seed</A>, <A HREF="#galaxy_colour_turb">galaxy_colour_turb</A>, <A HREF="#galaxy_intensity">galaxy_intensity</A>,
   <A HREF="#galaxy_rotate">galaxy_rotate</A>, <A HREF="#galaxy_distance">galaxy_distance</A>, <A HREF="#galaxy_origin">galaxy_origin</A>
   <A HREF="#galaxy_colour options">galaxy_colour1, galaxy_colour2, galaxy_colour3</A>, <A HREF="#galaxy_star_colouration">galaxy_star_colouration</A>,
   <A HREF="#galaxy_pattern_scale">galaxy_pattern_scale</A>, <A HREF="#galaxy_pattern_origin">galaxy_pattern_origin</A>, <A HREF="#galaxy_turb_origin">galaxy_turb_origin</A>
   </UL>
   

<P><A NAME="galaxy_object_name"></A>
<B>galaxy_object_name</B>
<HR>
Use this option to select which galaxy object you wish to use.  Possible
values are (the case of the strings is not important):

<UL>Star1, Star2, Star3, Star4
<BR>Nebula1, Nebula2, Nebula3, Nebula4, Nebula5, Nebula6
<BR>Galaxy1, Galaxy2, Galaxy3, Galaxy4, Galaxy5
<BR>Comet1, Comet2, Comet3
<BR>Meteor1, Meteor2
</UL>

<P>As a shortcut you can just use the first and last letters of the object
name, eg. S3 for Star3, or N4 for Nebula4.  If you don't want to create
a galaxy object, set this value to an empty string.
The default <I>galaxy_object_name</I> is Nebula1

<P><A NAME="galaxy_object_scale"></A>
<B>galaxy_object_scale</B>
<HR>
Use this option to increase of decrease the size of the galaxy object.
The default <I>galaxy_object_scale</I> value is 1

<P><A NAME="galaxy_object_rotate"></A>
<B>galaxy_object_rotate</B>
<HR>
Use this option to rotate the galaxy object.  The object is rotated around
the viewing axis, so only one float value is required.
The default <I>galaxy_object_rotate</I> value is 0

<P><A NAME="galaxy_object_flatten"></A>
<B>galaxy_object_flatten</B>
<HR>
Use this option to flatten Galaxy, Comet, and Meteor objects.  Good values
lie somewhere between 0 (no flattening) and 1 (completely flattened).  You
can also use negative numbers to widen the object instead of thinning it.
The default <I>galaxy_object_flatten</I> value is 0.2

<P><A NAME="galaxy_object_position"></A>
<B>galaxy_object_position</B>
<HR>
Use this option to move the galaxy object and cluster objects.  The
x-component of this option specifies the altitude of the objects, while the
y-component specifies the azimuth of the objects.  The z-component is
ignored.  The default value of &lt 0, 0, 0&gt positions the objects directly
perpendicular to the z-axis.  North lies along the z-axis and up lies along
the y-axis.  Therefore, &lt 90, 0, 0&gt positions the object directly above the
origin, and &lt-90, 0, 0&gt positions the objects below the origin.  &lt 0, 90, 0&gt
positions the objects to the east (along the x-axis), &lt 0, -90, 0&gt positions
the objects to the west (along the negative x-axis), and &lt 0, 180, 0&gt
positions the objects to the south (along the negative z-axis).  You can
combine these two movements using the <I>galaxy_object_position</I> value to place
the galaxy object and cluster objects anywhere in the sky.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_cluster_name"></A>
<B>galaxy_cluster_name</B>
<HR>
In addition to a single galaxy object you can create a cluster of randomly
positioned, sized, and coloured objects.  Use this option to select which
object you wish to use for the cluster, using the same selection as
the <A HREF="#galaxy_object_name">galaxy_object_name</A> option.  If you don't want to create
a cluster of objects, set this option to an empty string.
The default <I>galaxy_cluster_name</I> is Star1

<P><A NAME="galaxy_cluster_objects"></A>
<B>galaxy_cluster_objects</B>
<HR>
Use this option to set the number of objects you want to create in the
cluster.  The default <I>galaxy_cluster_objects</I> value is 6

<P><A NAME="galaxy_cluster_scale"></A>
<B>galaxy_cluster_scale</B>
<HR>
Use this option to increase of decrease the size of the individual objects
in the cluster (not the overall size of the cluster itself).  The default
<I>galaxy_cluster_scale</I> value is half of the <A HREF="#galaxy_object_scale">galaxy_object_scale</A> value.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_cluster_rotate"></A>
<B>galaxy_cluster_rotate</B>
<HR>
Use this option to rotate each individual object in the cluster (not the
cluster as a whole).  The default <I>galaxy_cluster_rotate</I> value is the same
as the <A HREF="#galaxy_object_rotate">galaxy_object_rotate</A> value.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_cluster_spread"></A>
<B>galaxy_cluster_spread</B>
<HR>
Use this option to increase the amount of space between the individual
cluster objects.  The option is expressed as an angle, where 0 results in
all the objects being clustered at the same position, while 360 spreads the
objects across the entire sky.
The default <I>galaxy_cluster_spread</I> value is 15 degrees.

<P><A NAME="galaxy_scale_turb"></A>
<B>galaxy_scale_turb</B>
<HR>
Use this option to alter the amount of size variation between individual
cluster objects.  Setting this option to 0 results in all the cluster
objects being the same size, while larger values give greater size
variation.  The default <I>galaxy_scale_turb</I> value is 0.5

<P><A NAME="galaxy_rotate_turb"></A>
<B>galaxy_rotate_turb</B>
<HR>
Use this option to alter the amount of variation (in degrees) between the
rotations of individual cluster objects.  Setting this option to 0 results
in all the cluster objects being rotated by the same amount, while setting
this option to 360 gives objects rotated by completely random angles.
The default <I>galaxy_rotate_turb</I> value is 0

<P><A NAME="galaxy_declare_only"></A>
<B>galaxy_declare_only</B>
<HR>
Setting this option to true stops <I>Galaxy.obj</I> from actually creating the
galaxy object and cluster objects.  Instead, these objects are declared
(as <CODE>galaxy_object</CODE> and <CODE>galaxy_cluster_object</CODE> respectively) as textured
discs which can be used like any other object.  The discs are scaled
and rotated according to the relevant options above, and are centred
at the origin perpendicular to the z-axis.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><I>TROUBLESHOOTING</B></I></FONT>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
This section contains some common problems you might encounter while using
the Galaxy Include File package, and instructions on how to fix these
problems.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) POV-Ray crashes when I try to render my galaxy scene?</B>
<BR>A: This may be caused by objects being larger than POV-Ray's allowed limit.
   To make the objects smaller, try decreasing the <A HREF="#galaxy_distance">galaxy_distance</A> value
   (the default is 10000), and also the <A HREF="#star_distance">star_distance</A> value if you have
   declared this separately.  If reducing this value doesn't help, try
   reducing the <I>max_trace_level</I> of your scene; the Galaxy Include File
   automatically increases the value for each object it creates, so add
   the line:

<P><CODE>global_settings {max_trace_level 10}</CODE>

<P><B>after</B> including any of the <I>Galaxy.*</I> files.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) POV-Ray crashes before even starting to render my galaxy scene?</B>
<BR>A: This is probably caused by a lack of memory; try decreasing your
   <A HREF="#star_count">star_count</A> value, or your <A HREF="#galaxy_cluster_objects">galaxy_cluster_objects</A> value if they
   are quite large.  Otherwise, check the error message POV-Ray gives
   you; you have probably tried to redeclare an option that has
   already been used by one of the Galaxy Include Files; ensuring that
   options are always declared as the same type (eg. vectors are always
   redeclared as vectors, etc.) should remove the problem.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) POV-Ray renders my galaxy scene, but it is very slow?</B>
<BR>A: This is probably caused by very large objects; try reducing the
   <A HREF="#galaxy_distance">galaxy_distance</A> and/or <A HREF="#star_distance">star_distance</A> options as detailed in the first
   question.  Note, however, that when using many complex pigments like
   those used by the Galaxy Include Files a certain amount of calculation
   time is to be expected.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I have created an animation using the Galaxy Include File, but the
   stars seems to flicker annoyingly?</B>
<BR>A: This is caused by using background stars (mapped to the sky_sphere)
   which are only suitable for still scenes.  Try setting the
   <A HREF="#galaxy_sky_sphere">galaxy_sky_sphere</A> option to false <B>before</B> including the <I>Galaxy.*</I> files
   to remove the problem.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I am using the <I>galaxy_pattern_origin</I> and/or <I>galaxy_turb_origin</I> options,
   and there are some strange artefacts in my galaxy scene?</B>
<BR>A: This is caused by problems with POV-Ray's internal pigment mapping
   functions; you should be able to fix the problem by using smaller values
   for the <A HREF="#galaxy_pattern_origin">galaxy_pattern_origin</A> and <A HREF="#galaxy_turb_origin">galaxy_turb_origin</A> options.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I have tried declaring some of the options, but nothing changes?</B>
<BR>A: Make sure that you have declared all the desired options <B>before</B>
   including any of the <I>Galaxy.*</I> files.  The files are not designed
   to be included once at the beginning of a scene.

<P><HR>
<B>Q) How can I use the Galaxy Include File with Moray (or another modeller)?</B>
<BR>A: First export your scene from your modeller to a POV file.  Then just add
   your desired galaxy options to this file, and include the desired
   <I>Galaxy.*</I> files before rendering the scene.  If your modeller uses a
   right handed coordinate system (like Moray) declare these two options
   before any others to ensure that the galaxy objects are positioned
   properly:

<P><CODE>#declare galaxy_distance = &lt -1, 1, 1&gt * 10000;
<BR>#declare galaxy_rotate = &lt -90, 180, 0&gt ;</CODE>

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I want to fly around a galaxy I have created, but this doesn't seem possible?</B>
<BR>A: This is because the galaxy objects are designed to generally be viewed in the background, and so they are placed at a great distance from the other objects in a scene.
You can, however, use any of the galaxy objects just as you would any other object in POV-Ray, so that it can translated, rotated, scaled, etc.
Just use the <A HREF="#galaxy_declare_only">galaxy_declare_only</A> option to create the <CODE>galaxy_object</CODE>, eg:

<P><CODE>#declare galaxy_colour1 = &lt 1.3, 1.2, .9&gt ;
<BR>#declare galaxy_colour2 = &lt .4, .8, 1&gt ;
<BR>#declare galaxy_cluster_name = ""

<P>#declare galaxy_object_name = "Galaxy3"
<BR>#declare galaxy_object_flatten = 0;
<BR>#declare galaxy_declare_only = true;
<BR>#include "Galaxy.obj"
<BR>object {galaxy_object rotate x * 90 scale 10}

<P>camera {location &lt 1, 2, -3&gt look_at &lt 0, .5, 0&gt}</CODE>

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I rendered my galaxy image using anti-aliasing and all the stars disappeared?</B>
<BR>A: This is usually the result of using the <I>Galaxy.bg</I> file to create stars as a pigment on the sky_sphere.
Stars created in this manner will not work well with anti-aliasing, and it is usually a good idea to set the <A HREF="#galaxy_bgstars">galaxy_bgstars</A> option to false to remove these background stars if you plan to render the image with anti-aliasing turned on.
In their place, you should use the stars created by <I>Galaxy.sf</I>, as these are actual objects with pigments that have already been anti-aliased.
The best settings for a scene usually depend on the rendering size, but for an 800x600 image these settings work quite well:

<P><CODE>#declare star_count = 5000;
<BR>#declare star_scale = .5;
<BR>#include "Galaxy.sf"</CODE>

<P><HR>
<B>Q) I can't get media to work with the Galaxy Include Files?</B>
<BR>A: Due to the way the Galaxy Include Files create the galaxy objects and stars, the results obtained using POV-Ray 3.1's media can be unpredictable.
Part of the problem is caused by the galaxy objects usually being at a great distance from the other objects in a scene, which makes it very difficult for POV-Ray to calculate accurate media interactions.
One solution is to decrease the <A HREF="#galaxy_distance">galaxy_distance</A> option to bring the galaxy objects closer to the camera, although this can make it difficult to place other objects correctly.
A better solution might be to use localised media container objects, rather than atmospheric media, to only place the media in those sections of the scene that it is required for.
This should give you more control over the media interactions in your scene, and possibly increase the rendering speed as well.
