  - Each level is fullscreen
  - Can have different size and wrap horizontally
  - Can be compiled into Airstrike or be dynamically loaded modules
- game engine:
  - sprite engine:
    - freely rotating rigid body code
    - pixel perfect collisions
    - signaling
    - objects can regenerate themselves
 - realistic plane aerodynamics
    - wind according to object position + size
  - ai can find enemies (long range + short range scanning)
  - antialiasing
- preliminary (positional) sound support
- console mode for setting game options
- damages and score keeping
- objects:
  - planes + firing + bombs
  - bonus machine + bonus balloons
  - cannon + cannon balls
  - zeppelin + wreck

  - parachute man
  - birds
- bonuses:
  - Bird/airballoon/zeppelin which follows the plane
  - A new cloud in which you can hide
- all graphics are raytraced

  - automatic graphics generation from POV-models
- documentation:
  - textual code descriptions
  - architecture diagram
  - man page
- windows version and rpm + deb packages

Discarded features:
- Larger than screen / scrolling levels. They were not very playable
  in multiplay mode without split screen support
- Tile based backgrounds. With single fullscreen background image it's
