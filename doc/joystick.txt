Joystick input is modeled after the existing keyboard input routines.
Instead of using the SDL event system the joysticks are polled whenever an
update message is sent to a sprite controlled by a human player. Different
to the keyboard input there is a seperate function to get the current
joystick state that has to be called before checking the state.
Joystick input is digital, i.e. any (axis) movement above a certain
threshold is interpreted as the corresponding action (e.g. acceleration).
The mapping of joystick input to game actions is read from a config file
(with hardcoded defaults in engine/ai.c if no config file is present)
similar to the keyboard configuration. Each player can use up to one
joystick (several players could share a joystick ;).
