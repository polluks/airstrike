BONUSES
=======

"Bonus machine" at the top of the screen creates a new balloon every
30secs.  When balloon is "popped", you see stars and after 1 sec, a
random bonus appears in middle of them. Bonus goes away after a little
while.

This are the bonuses:

Airballoon
  Airballoon starts to follow the plane until plane
  is killed or plane grabs same bonus again.
  (eero)

Bird
  The leader bird follows the plane until plane dies.
  (eero)

Bomb
  Player gets one (or two) more bomb.
  (eero)

Cloud
  Cloud appears from either side of the screen and disappears when
  it floats off the other side.
  (eero)

Heart
  Computer plane stops shooting the player and just chases his/her
  plane, trailing hearts, until player's plane dies or 15 sec has
  expired, whichever happens first.
  (TODO, doens't work anymore)

Parachute
  Pilot gets a claustrofobic fit and jumps off the plane with parachute.
  You have to hit the hangar to get a new plane (with full energy &
  bombs), otherwise you die.
  (ulf?)

Energy ('+' shaped)
  Plane energy is restored back to maximum.
  (eero)

Fork
  Plane "splits" to two planes, controlled with the same AI (keys).

Ufo
  Ufo appears from the top and starts shooting "heat-seeking" missiles
  at the plane. It stops / disappears only when either plane or
  the ufo die.
  (ulf?)

Zeppelin
  Zeppelin starts to follow the plane until either zeppelin or plane
  is killed or plane grabs the same bonus again.
  (eero)


So, Ufo bonus is dangerous, zeppelin, parachute, cloud, bird and
airballoon bonuses could be annoying and others are beneficial.  Do
you think this is good balance so that player got enough incentive to
try to catch them (and accidentally get the nasty 'ufo' bonus :))?
