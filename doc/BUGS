Dragon wings are motion blurred even when gliding.

Collision detection does not work very well when an object is
completely inside another. The collision is detected, but there is no
transfer of momentum etc. This is due to the lack of a suitable
normal, but should be handled anyway.

The collision routines makes object resting on the
ground a bit shaky.

No friction in collisions.
