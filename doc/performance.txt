How to make the game run faster (for the user):

Set your display to 15 or 16 bits per pixels.

Make the window smaller.

Turn off alpha channel sprites (this will not give you
hardware acceleration at the moment).


For developers:

Things that could be done faster (in order of importance):

* Use some partitioning scheme to make collision detection be
  less than O(N^2).

* Sprites that are just for display (ie effects) does not need
  masks or all of the features of regular sprites. Make them a
  separate type of object.

* Enable hardware acceleration where possible.

* Change alarms from O(nr waiting) to O(nr active) (ie to a sorted queue).

Some profiling:

Running 100000 frames without blitting (2 ai planes, about 20 mech
objects, typical game scene) gives:

real    0m29.486s
user    0m22.230s
sys     0m1.370s

real    0m29.081s
user    0m22.000s
sys     0m1.440s

This includes loading, converting, building masks etc.

Looks like < 0.22 ms/frame. Pretty good imo.

without cropping:

real    0m33.266s
user    0m25.710s
sys     0m1.290s
 
real    0m32.949s
user    0m25.960s
sys     0m1.460s

With extra optimization (-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -foptimize-sibling-calls -march=i686) about 19s user time. 

With about 50 biplanes in a heap on the ground things look like

On this machine this means approx 2us/overlap_area, 1us/overlap_pos..
This is an extreme situation, so it's probably nothing to worry about.
This is without cropping.
